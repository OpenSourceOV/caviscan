# Caviscan

Caviscan currently only works with VueScan version 9.5.81. There is a legacy version (in /legacy) which works with older versions but this has only been tested on VueScan 9.5.53 - see note below. 

## Note on using the legacy version
In order to use the legacy version you must manually set the Infrared Clean option under the 'Filter' tab to 'None' otherwise you'll land up with images of different dimensions.
